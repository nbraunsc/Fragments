diamond.log = casscf on RHF/6-31g optimized diamond

ci_nv.log = casci with 4 roots on RHF/6-31g optimized nv center with charge = -1

cas_nv.log = casscf with 4 roots on RHF/6-31g optimized nv cneter with charge = -1

cluster_cas  = casscf on C42H42NV cluster, Delany paper does CI on this cluster with ecp's and DZV(P) basis

cluster_ci = casci with 5 roots on C42H42NV cluster (not optimized yet)
